## Demos
This folder contains standalone demos that show different BART use cases. The demos are self-documented within
each directory, and are summarized below.

1. Simulate phantom data and compare regularized reconstructions  ([`pics-phantom`](pics-phantom))
2. Reconstruct an axial slice of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) data ([`pics-dce`](pics-dce))
3. Build a GRASP reconstruction tool with bash scripting and BART command-line tools ([`grasp`](grasp))
4. Use the Wave-CS reconstruction tool using the BART Matlab API ([`wave`](wave-cs))
