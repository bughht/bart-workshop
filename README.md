# BART Workshop Materials

This repository contains information and demos for the [Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART)](http://mrirecon.github.io/bart).


## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to host and share demos and workshop materials for BART. From the [website](http://mrirecon.github.io/bart):

> The Berkeley Advanced Reconstruction Toolbox (BART) is a free and open-source image-reconstruction framework
> for Computational Magnetic Resonance Imaging. It consists of a programming library and a toolbox of command-line
> programs. The library provides common operations on multi-dimensional arrays, Fourier and wavelet transforms,
> as well as generic implementations of iterative optimization algorithms. The command-line tools provide direct
> access to basic operations on multi-dimensional arrays as well as efficient implementations of many calibration
> and reconstruction algorithms for parallel imaging and compressed sensing.

## Getting Started
The most up-to-date information can be found at the official BART website: http://mrirecon.github.io/bart.

## Quick Installation
See the [Quick-Install guide](doc/quick-install.md) for quick installation instructions.
